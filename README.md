## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was trying to use min-width and max-width together. Turns out that might not work correctly.

### Continued development

For the social links, I am thinking of using a fake api using json-server to fetch the link data and use React for frontend.

### Useful resources

- [How to use downloaded custom fonts](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+use+a+downloaded+font+css) - This helped me use the downloaded font correctly.
